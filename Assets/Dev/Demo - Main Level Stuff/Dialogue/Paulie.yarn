{$Paulie}: Hey you're awake!
{$Paulie}: I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw you washed up on the shore... all we normally get washing up is trash!
{$Paulie}: Speaking of...
{$Paulie}: I was just looking at all this trash that just has up on the beach... it's far too heavy for me to move so it just keeps piling up
{$Paulie}: Hey how about this! If you help me, I'll try to help you get back to wherever it is that you washed up from!
    -> Uh, I can't seem to remember how I got here but... Sure, I'll help! 

{$Paulie}: Yipee! Thank you so much! If you follow me, I'll take you to the bulk of it! *chirp*

Paulie: Ugh, look at all this trash.
Paulie: It feels like there’s more here every day… and for the first time that I can remember it's starting to go away, all thanks to you!
Paulie: Funnily enough this island used to be a massive recycling plant... But that has been broken down ever since most of the humans left...
	-> Left?
Paulie: ..!!
Paulie: Hey hang on just a second! You're exactly what we need!
    -> Me? What for?
Paulie: You're a Human! What can’t you do!? You can make things and fix stuff! You humans have no idea how much power you really have!
    -> I'm confused... what do you need my help with?
Paulie: Don’t worry, I’ve just thought of a way we can use this stuff to help with your situation!
	-> The garbage I just picked up? How?
Paulie: Just come with me! You'll see soon enough!

{$Paulie}: Wow, it's crazy what some people just throw away.
{$Paulie}: And hey! that's looks like the key to the gate! I thought it must be around here somewhere... Never bothered looking though because I just fly right over!
{$Paulie}: This island used to be a massive recycling plant until the world stopped caring and the funding dried out
{$Paulie}: ..!! 
{$Paulie}: Hey hang on just a second!
{$Paulie}: You might be just what we need!
    -> Me? What for?
{$Paulie}: You're a Human! What couldn't we use you for? You can make stuff and fix things! 
{$Paulie}: You humans have no idea how much power you really have! Besides, while you can't remember anything there's not much we can do in terms of getting you home...
    -> I'm confused... what do you need my help with?
{$Paulie}: No time, come with me! You'll see soon enough! Besides, I think it's about time you met S.P.A.R.C.! Follow me, we're going to the plant!
    -> Okay, if you say so!

<<SetPortrait GameManager $Sparc>>
{$Sparc}: *bzzt* Would you keep it down? It's bad enough being stuck with you as my only hope of fixing this place up without you rattling my circuits around with that screeching
<<ForcedOutlineEnd SparcNPC>>
<<SetPortrait GameManager $Paulie>>
Paulie: Well I may not be your only hope anymore! I found a human!
<<ForcedOutlineEnd PaulieNPC>>
<<SetPortrait GameManager $Sparc>>
{$Sparc}: Huh?...a human?! Oh! Hi! I barely saw you there. Where did you come from? I thought you guys all left for Mars…
    -> I... don't actually remember.. I just remember waking up and then Paulie finding me..
{$Sparc}: Well, whatever the case, good timing! I have done everything in my abilities to get this stuff in working order before we get buried in trash!
{$Sparc}: But with a literal extra set of hands, I think might be just about ready to get these machines up and running!
    -> What is this place? and what's all this stuff for?
{$Sparc}: This? This here is the long-dormant heart of a beautiful recycling plant! It was designed by my old master! One of the only humans that cared enough to stick around!
{$Sparc}: *bzzt* I've been working my bolts off trying to get this thing back in working order since he's... well, there's only so much you can do with no limbs...
{$Sparc}: I used to help the humans run this place but they're all gone now...
    -> What happened?
{$Sparc}: Well…the humans got too greedy. Turning a blind eye and laying waste to the planet was good for business, you see. Eventually, there was nothing left to take. 
{$Sparc}: Those rich enough took everything they could  and left for Mars, leaving everyone else to deal the pollution.
	-> That's terrible...
{$Sparc}: But we're not giving up yet! This planet isn't going to save itself, and as long as there's still juice in my circuits I'll be doing everything I can! 

//Sparc: The world is at its tipping point, you see. If we don’t clear this trash, it’ll leach into the environment more and more until nothing can survive!

{$Sparc}: We must get this conveyor belt up and running! All I need is a few components, but all of the stuff we find is too gunked up and would damage the machines!
<<ForcedOutlineEnd SparcNPC>>
<<SetPortrait GameManager $Paulie>>
{$Paulie}: That stuff we two cleaned up from the beach might even have exactly what we need! And that door up above us leads to the wash station but.. there's just one problem...
<<ForcedOutlineEnd PaulieNPC>>
<<SetPortrait GameManager $Sparc>>
{$Sparc}: I'd do it myself if I could, but me and water don't mix well! And Paulie... well
<<ForcedOutlineEnd SparcNPC>>
<<SetPortrait GameManager $Paulie>>
{$Paulie}: Let's just say there's a reason why you don't see many birds using pressure washers
-> You don't even have to ask, I'm in! How can I help?
{$Paulie}: Just head straight up those stairs to the right! A lot of the facilities in this plant have instructions built in so just head on up!
<<ForcedOutlineEnd PaulieNPC>>

//Sparc: Well, the backbone of this place is this conveyor belt, but we still need a few final components... Hey, hang on... Paulie did you guys bring any scrap from the beach?
//Paulie: Yep, not sure how much of it is useful though…
//Sparc: You'd be surprised at some of the stuff that finds its way to our shores. Hey human, If you're still happy to help out, could you take the trash you collected to the sink over there? You can’t recycle dirty stuff!

{$Paulie}: Well I may not be your only hope anymore! I found a human!
{$Sparc}: Huh?... Oh! Hi! I barely saw you there. Where on earth did you come from? We are quite literally in the middle of nowhere, so guests aren't exactly common
-> I uh... huh. I don't actually remember. As a matter of fact, all I do remember is waking right as Paulie found me on the shore...
{$Sparc}: Well your timing is impecable! I just don't have the means to get this stuff in working order. But with a literal extra set of hands, I think we are just about ready to get these machines up and running!
-> What is this place? and what does all this stuff for?
{$Sparc}: This? This here is the long dormant heart of one of the largest recycling plant on the planet
{$Sparc}: Well... at least it was
{$Sparc}: Until all the humans just set their sights on leaving this planet instead of taking care of it
-> ...
{$Sparc}: But we haven't given up yet! This planet isn't going to save itself, and as long as there's still juice in my circuits I'll be doing everything I can. The world is at it's tipping point, you see
{$Sparc}: Pretty soon things will permanently shift beyond the point of no return and the world won't be inhabitable by anything, not just humans
{$Sparc}: That's why we have to get this place up and running! 
{$Sparc}: We need your help! With you, we have the power to shift the balance back and restore the earth to its former glory! 
-> Well, when you put it that way...
    -> I'm In! How can I help?
{$Sparc}: Well, the backbone of this place is this conveyor belt, but we still need a few final components... Hey, hang on... Paulie did you guys bring any scrap from the beach?
{$Paulie}: Yep, I don't see how a bunch of rubbish is going to help us though
{$Sparc}: You'd be surprised at some of the stuff that finds its way to our shores... Hey Human? If you're still happy to help out, could you take the trash you collected over to our pressurized cleaning sink? That way we can get it all cleaned up and see what we're working with
-> Okay!

{$Paulie}: Once we shred up all the new scrap, I think we'll be set on copper for the radio tower repairs.

{$Sparc}: As a matter of fact, pretty much every bit of scrap you find can be repurposed in some way through this plant now it has awoken from its slumber!
