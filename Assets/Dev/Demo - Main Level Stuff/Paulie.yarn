Paulie: WaAAAAAA!!
Paulie: Hey! What the.... A human! 
Paulie: Are you alive, human?
-> *cough*
Paulie: Oh, ..okay. Ill take that as a yes!
-> Where am I?
Paulie: Well, I'll put it this way... I don't know where you washed up from, but it can't have been anywhere nearby. This island is half way across the Pacific!
Paulie: Were you in a shipwreck or something? 
-> I.. I-I don't remember..
Paulie: No memory huh? maybe you got a knock to the head or something!
-> hmmm ...I don't even remember my name
Paulie: Look, I'd love to help you figure out this whole mess but I'm a little busy at the moment with this trash that keeps washing up on our shores
Paulie: If something serious doesn't change soon, this whole shoreline will be so choked up with rubbish that we won't be able to leave this island. 
Paulie: I'll tell you what. If you help me clear up this trash, I'll try my best to help you find out what happened to you and see if we can't get you home!
Paulie: Besides, we're gonna need to get some supplies if you want to use the radio tower to call for help! Last night's storm knocked down one of the lines and we're running real low on copper. Who knows what we'll find in these junk piles

Paulie: Wow, it's crazy what some people just throw away. 
Paulie: And this island would've seen plenty of it! 
Paulie: This island used to be a massive recycling plant until the world stopped caring and the funding dried out
Paulie: ..!! 
Paulie: Hey hang on just a second!
Paulie: You might be just what we need!
-> Me? What for?
Paulie: You're a Human! What couldn't we use you for? You can make stuff and fix things! You humans have no idea how much power you really have! Besides, while you can't remember anything there's not much we can do in terms of getting you home...
-> I'm confused... what do you need my help with?
Paulie: No time, come with me! You'll see soon enough!
Paulie: I think it's about time you met Sparc

Paulie: Sparc? 
Paulie: SPAA-ARC!
Sparc: Would you keep it down? It's bad enough being stuck with you as my only hope of fixing this place up without you rattling my circuits around with that screetching
Paulie: Well I may not be your only hope anymore! I found a human!
Sparc: Huh?... Oh! Hi! I barely saw you there. Where on earth did you come from? We are quite literally in the middle of nowhere, so guests aren't exactly common
-> I uh... huh. I don't actually remember. As a matter of fact, all I do remember is waking right as Paulie found me on the shore...
Sparc: Well your timing is impecable! I just don't have the means to get this stuff in working order. But with a literal extra set of hands, I think we are just about ready to get these machines up and running!
-> What is this place? and what does all this stuff for?
Sparc: This? This here is the long dormant heart of one of the largest recycling plant on the planet
Sparc: Well... at least it was
Sparc: Until all the humans just set their sights on leaving this planet instead of taking care of it
-> ...
Sparc: But we haven't given up yet! This planet isn't going to save itself, and as long as there's still juice in my circuits I'll be doing everything I can. The world is at it's tipping point, you see
Sparc: Pretty soon things will permanently shift beyond the point of no return and the world won't be inhabitable by anything, not just humans
Sparc: That's why we have to get this place up and running! 
Sparc: We need your help! With you, we have the power to shift the balance back and restore the earth to its former glory! 
-> Well, when you put it that way...
    -> I'm In! How can I help?
Sparc: Well, the backbone of this place is this conveyor belt, but we still need a few final components... Hey, hang on... Paulie did you guys bring any scrap from the beach?
Paulie: Yep, I don't see how a bunch of rubbish is going to help us though
Sparc: You'd be surprised at some of the stuff that finds its way to our shores... Hey Human? If you're still happy to help out, could you take the trash you collected over to our pressurized cleaning sink? That way we can get it all cleaned up and see what we're working with
-> Okay!

Sparc: Okay let me see what we've got here... 
Sparc: Aha! This should do it! Alright!
Sparc: Alright, I'll make the appropriate modifications and then we can fire this old thing up!
*whirrr*
Sparc: ...I don't believe it
Sparc: It actually still runs!
Paulie: I'll be honest, I had lost hope of ever seeing this thing functioning again but I stand corrected! 
Sparc: Well Human, if you'll do the honours, I think the rest of that trash you cleaned up should be a perfect test run for the conveyor. Let's hope you've brushed up on your bin knowledge!

Sparc: Well. if I was unsorted trash, I'd think twice before messing with you!
Paulie: Right, now time to see about that wire! 
Paulie: Once we shred up all the new scrap, I think we'll be set on copper for the radio tower repairs.
Sparc: As a matter of fact, pretty much every bit of scrap you find can be repurposed in some way through this plant now it has awoken from its slumber!
