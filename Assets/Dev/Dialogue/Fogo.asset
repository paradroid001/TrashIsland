  dialogue:
  - Ohohoho! I have found it! An oasis of beautiful nature!
  - This is amazing! Trees and animals! Look at this parrot! I'll call it Paullie!
    Sparc, Paullie and I are going to find a way to spread nature back to the rest
    of the world!
  - If only we didn't make all of the stuff we did, we wouldn't be in this situation.
    Mass production on the scale that we had it back in the day brought us here.
