# GAD375Prototyper
A prototyping package for Unity to be used with the GAD375 unit

This package helps construct rough layout and structure for game levels by providing some basic tools for the interaction of dialogue with Unity behaviours such as hiding/showing objects, moving objects, triggering animations, and changing materials.

A small example scene is provided - See the wiki (https://github.com/paradroid001/GAD375Prototyper/wiki) for a guide to setting up a scene and using the vatious behaviour commands.
The example scene requires:
* A Unity project using the Universal Render Pipeline package: either from the template or installed from the package manager.
* The TextMeshPro package: install it from the Unity package manager.
* YarnSpinner for Unity: download and import the package from https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner
